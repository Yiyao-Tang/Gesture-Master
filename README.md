We initially intended to make it for our Escendo 2021 Makathon competition. The topic was Healthcare Industry and the gesture master is our answer. With the help of Aduino and Python, our team offers the solution to singaprean hospitals to support the ward-control system, and thus help solve the manpower shortage and bring convenience to patients. <br>
Lastly we won the most innovative prize for our team, considered as the first prize.
